this is a pretty simple repo/backup of my personal dotfiles/setup scripts, for my main machine, some adaptations will be available eventually to make this work for a laptop as well, since i dont want to make 1 repo for each of my machines.
The objetive is to make it as reproducible as possible with the tools inside, using scripts.

might not work for everybody as of yet since i have a very basic understanding of scripts and linux in general.
the point is to eventually just clone and click a button to apply it to any machine. 

also i love tuis so there are a lot of those in this 


### Dependencies: 

- sysstat

## todo 

package install automation

custom cursor

greetertui theme

explore turning the setup.sh into a makefile (better automatic version control etc )
