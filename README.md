this is a pretty simple repo/backup of my personal dotfiles/setup scripts, for my laptop. The objetive is to make it as reproducible as possible with the tools inside.

 



##todo 

neovim config (disaster rip off lmao)

package install automation

custom cursor

greetertui theme

explore turning the setup.sh into a makefile (better automatic version control etc )

install script for arch?
